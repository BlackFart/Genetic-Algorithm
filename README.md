# Genetic-Algorithm
A simple program using genetic algorithm to generate your input.

## Necessary Package(s)
Numpy

## Pros
Instead of brute forcing each bit of a string, this program is using genetic algorithm that leads to the input by iterations.
Useful in complex biological simulations.

## Cons
Not fast enough.
The number of iterations deponds on luck.
